# Sleep Health & Lifestyle

In this project, I aim to analyze sleep health and lifestyle habits to understand how they influence everyday life. To achieve this, I followed several key steps:

- EDA (Exxploratory Data Analysis).
- Feature Engineering. 
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality.
- KMeans in order to classify the whole dataset into clusters.

The project currently concludes with the clustering analysis, where the dataset is partitioned into four distinct groups based on similarities in sleep and lifestyle features.

The dataset is from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data). The data features:

Person ID: An identifier for each individual.

Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).

Age: The age of the person in years.

Occupation: The occupation or profession of the person.

Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the person sleeps per day.

Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Physical Activity Level (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.

Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.

BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).

Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.

Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.

Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.

Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).


ðŸ”§ Possible Improvements
My current project concludes with clustering analysis.<br> In the future, I plan to conduct deeper investigation on each cluster profiles to interpret key differences between groups.
